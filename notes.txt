rails new flags:
-T skip test files
-d postgresql
-B skip bundle, so you can add to gemfile first and
*** do bundle local when you don't have internet


What does it mean that rails "has foreign keys" now?

Prevents you from having records that can't exist in your system based on the rules you've defined

Polymorphism (should we or shouldn't we use it) - can't have foreign keys

Writing an API
- jbuilder (templating language for JSON, "you have everything in actionview helpers" like current user) gem
- activemodel serializers (has access to routing layer but not current user, so you'd have to monkey patch to bring in current user)

Hash and array are extended using as_json

for things like showing urls

App Engines
- isolated parts of rails app as its own app, devise and clarence do this
- decisions made by devise must be overridden (changing views)
- in devise, can't easily sign up with username and not email, sign in with username, change sign in form to have a few more fields
Monban
- you own your routes
- bcrypt problem, tests were slow b/c encrypting passwords is slow, monkeypatch the constant to be 1 so bcrypt only runs once

- if pg always asks for password, in pg_hba.conf peer/local trust

- launch ctl commands - run things like postgres from boot
- delete pid files if something's stuck

??? How does monban security compare to devise

*** Error - uninstall / reinstall gem when error about "library linked to" - your system has been updated since last time you've used that gem, updating static libraries

*** Migrations - integrity - always look at migrations
- null: false (don't need null values ???)- validations on db level (instead of validates presence true) - because the db can be hit from other sources than app

*** do in-model validations right after migration so you don't forget

- more integration tests, less unit tests (user fails to signup / succeeds, one happy path, one failure path, unit test for other failure paths)
- unit tests *are* useful for ... validator class (???) matrix test
- always TDD, don't add a method unless test indicates that it should

*** he does all private unless public needs (keep public interface as small as possible)
b/c nothing depends on them, so you can wait to see if there are patterns, to be open to refactoring

Private vs. Protected methods
- private - other instances of the same class can call this method (spaces)
- protected - compare by internal state that you don't want exposed to outside world

??? no interface checking, just public, private, protected

user = authenticate_session(session_params, email_or_username: %i(email username)) <- check if email matches OR username
%i returns symbols
%w returns strings

*** remote pairing - tmate (fork of tmux) and engrock??? good for pairing remotely cause you're looking at the same app
- easy as brew install engrock, engrock 3000

*** fresh app ***
- clear comments

*** limit controller actions to CRUD resources

*** encapsulation - knowing where to go - everything related -> put together somewhere
*** use whitespace correctly

encapsulation groupigngs = ???, ???, expectations

*** Shared partials -> application folder b/c template inheritence - "overwrite user bar by dumping in a partial" ???

*** duplicaiton - instead of finding similar code, but *intent is the same, even though they're the same right now, this one is oging to change in a different way

*** is_current_user vs. is_signed in (different intent by author) => adding layers of abstraction -> Lisp programming -> so eveything reads well

*** `route constraints` -  conditions for changing routes (use as little as possible, maybe just signed_in? / not)

before root "welcome#index", needs as: :dashboard
  constraints Monban::Constraints::SignedIn.new do
    root "dashboards#show", as: :dashboard
  end

*** looking at routes tells you almost everything you need to know about an app
*** security issue - be explicit about routes (always do only: [:new, :create, etc] so there's no forgotten vulnerable routes

*** database - rails still coming up to speed with databases (no foreign keys for example) `prepared statements` `laterals`

*** form_for is slow, simple_form is slower, raw html is good?
